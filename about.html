                        Bob Ross was an American painter, art instructor, and telivision host of the series <i>The Joy of Painting</i> on PBS. Born in Florida on October 29, 1942 Ross grew up in Orlando. At the age of 17 he decided to join the United States Air Force where he was transfered to Eielson Air Force Base, where he first witnessed the snow top covered mountains that would later become the theme of many of his great paintings. Eventually, he attained the rank of Master Sergeant causing him to portray a "tough guy" demeanor towards his cadets as is customary in the Air Force. Having spent most of his time in the Air Force in a position that demanded yelling and screaming to keep his cadets, Bob vowed to never scream again when he decided to end his military career in 1981. It was at this time when Ross decided to turn his passion for painting into a career.<br><br>

                        Two years later in 1983, Ross landed a deal to do a public television series called <i>The Joy of Painting</i>. The show would go on to be a huge success and run for a total of 31 seasons and 403 episodes. Each episode Ross would teach viewers oil painting tricks and techniques step by step building up to seemingly very professional paintings. Sticking to his former commitment of never screaming again he used a very soft and calming demeanor often being commared to another PBS star Fred Rogers. Throughout the years Ross would become a very influential and successful PBS star whos work and peaceful demeanor still lies in the hearts of many today. <i>The Joy of Painting</i>, can in fact still be seen on many PBS stations across the country.<br><br>

                        Bob Ross died on May 17, 1994. May he, or his beautiful art, never be forgotten.
